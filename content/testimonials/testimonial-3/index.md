I had the pleasure of working with Rohan for three years and have collaborated with him on several project teams. He is dedicated, self motivated and methodical in his approach. The SLAC project hinged on tight deadlines and a foray into new technologies. I was particularly impressed with Rohan's ability to adapt quickly and learn new skills to help drive the successful closure of the project. Rohan would be an asset to any team that is privileged to have him.
